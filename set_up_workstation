Install VirtualBox which is the default VM engine for Vagrant - and Vagrant itself.

    # apt-get install virtualbox
    # apt-get install vagrant

Add a Vagrant box image for Ubuntu 14.04 - or use another relevant Vagrant box image.

    $ vagrant box add ubuntu/trusty64

Create space for the VM to live.

    $ mkdir -p vagrant_machines/vm1/vm

Now create a Vagrant file which will use the ubuntu/trusty64 box.

    $ cd vagrant_machines/vm1/vm
    $ vagrant init ubuntu/trusty64

Next edit the Vagrant file which was created.  Mainly:

    config.vm.hostname = "thing.example.com"
